I recently decided, to try be more active in the InfoSec community. This is a bit of a Hobby to be completely honest. I’m a half decent Network Security Engineer currently working to arguably the highest level attainable in my field. (plan, design, implementation & 3rd tier support). 

I work from home and only rarely head to site, usually for project implementations. This means I spend my spare time studying things I enjoy or keeping fit. I'm aiming to undertake the OSCP by Summer 2019, then moving on to CCIE before the end of the year most likely. So if either of those subjects interest you, then maybe it will be worthwhile reading on.

I've been interested in Science, Technology and Security for as long as I can remember. Probably from watching the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

I've done quite a few little side projects over the years, but never really documented them. But moving forward, I'll start writing entries for anything I think of.

Over the last 12 months or so, I began to ramp up my efforts towards Pen Testing. I’ve just started the OSCP course by Offensive Security which I’ve been reliably informed is like the gateway drug for cyber-sec.

The bulk of this blog will be:
- Projects (most will be work based with critical info scraped out) 
- Studying (the endless task modern IT cattle)
- My optimism over IT & Sec in general. 

I’ll no doubt share my thoughts on futurology/ Science Fiction and anything else I think of. Mainly because I find it fascinating. 
Plus, my missus is sick of listening to it, to be honest!

Cheers,

Thomas
