Short Bash script for rebuilding L2 VLAN Database for CISCO Switches.

I've been learning more bash scripting recently, so I thought I'd try put some of this knowledge into real life examples.

I made this to copy existing VLAN database (vlan.dat) and convert it to CISCO IOS config without VTP or when there is no proper LAN Networking in place. Word of warning, this is pretty crude.

I'll maybe re-create this project in python at a later point. Since there is some value to it. I've never found anything online that can do this, which is kind of remarkable really.

This is quite a specific problem, but somehow every network engineer comes across it at one point or another.
All that's needed is Bash & this one liner.



### Step 1
Performed on Source switch that contains the *vlan.dat* that you want

`SwitchA#show vlan`

### Step 2
Copy output of *show vlan* and paste into **"input.txt"** on Linux machine

`root@Kali:/home/user1# nano input.txt`

Press Cntrl X then hit Y , followed by {ENTER}

### Step 3
Can grab the script from [here](https://github.com/eazeysec/Mini-projects/blob/master/l2-vlan-ez.sh).
Just copy this script into same directory as *input.txt*

Don't Forget to Make Executable

`root@Kali:/home/user1# chmod 755 l2-vlan-ez.sh`

![l2-vlan4](/images/l2-vlan4.JPG)

Run the script & View the output:

`root@Kali:/home/user1# ./l2-vlan-ez.sh`

`root@Kali:/home/user1# cat output.txt`

![l2-vlan5](/images/l2-vlan5.JPG)

Alternatively just grab the one liner (told you it's messy):
```bash
cat input.txt | grep '[0-9]' | cut -d" " -f1-5 | sed -e 's/^/Vlan /' | sed 's/\<Vlan [0-9][0-9][0-9]\>/& \nname/' | sed 's/\<Vlan [0-9]\>/& \nname/' | sed 's/\<Vlan [0-9][0-9]\>/& \nname/' | sed '/Vlan                 /d' > output.txt 
```

### Step 4
Paste into the new switch via console.
Remember to run it from Configuration Terminal Mode :)

Confirm the L2 Vlans are all in place.

No doubt there are 100 better ways to do this, but it got the job done. Functionality over everything.

Cheers,
