Been a hectic month:

- Got engaged 
- Celebrated Girlfriend's Bday (or is it Fianc√©e?) 
- Went on a friends stag trip
- First trip to a Michelin Star restaurant 

So I've not spent a lot of time on Sec studies, but that doesn't mean I've stood still. 
Put quite a bit of focus on some new Solar Winds features, mainly the automated Cisco CVE checks & associated reporting.

A lot of noise surrounding the PSIRT lists and this tool seems to basically do it all for you, completely automated.

Also notched up a couple of other wins on [HackTheBox](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/71491)

I've been meaning to go buy pro and hit up some of the pro labs. It's on the to do list.


Cheers,
Thomas
